# Week 7 – Security Audit and System Evaluation

## Aim
## Introduction

## Step 1: System Security Audit (Lynis)

### Commands Used:
```bash
sudo lynis audit system
```
### Evidence:
A full system security audit was conducted using Lynis. The scan completed successfully and reported a Hardening Index score of 61. The output confirmed that multiple security controls are enabled, while also identifying areas for further hardening. A screenshot of the completed Lynis audit showing the hardening index and summary results was captured as evidence.



### Outcome:
The Lynis audit provided an overview of the system’s current security posture. The results indicate that the system has a reasonable baseline level of security, but additional hardening opportunities exist to further reduce risk and improve compliance with security best practices.


### Reflection:
Using Lynis helped identify security strengths and weaknesses in a structured and automated way. This audit improves understanding of system hardening techniques and highlights the importance of continuous security assessment in maintaining a secure operating system.
