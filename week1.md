# Week 1 – System Planning and Distribution Selection

## Overview
This week focuses on planning the operating system deployment, selecting an appropriate Linux
server distribution, and documenting the system architecture and network configuration.

## System Architecture

The system follows a dual-system architecture. A Windows workstation is used as the
administrative client, while a headless Ubuntu Server virtual machine runs the server
operating system. All server administration is performed remotely via SSH.
