# Week 1 – System Planning and Distribution Selection

## Overview
This week focuses on planning the operating system deployment, selecting an appropriate Linux
server distribution, and documenting the system architecture and network configuration.

## System Architecture
The system follows a dual-system architecture. A Windows workstation is used as the
administrative client, while a headless Ubuntu Server virtual machine runs the server
operating system. All server administration is performed remotely via SSH.

## Distribution Selection
Ubuntu Server was selected as the server operating system for this coursework.
It is a stable, widely used Linux server distribution with long-term support (LTS),
making it suitable for secure and reliable server deployments.

Compared to alternatives such as CentOS or Debian, Ubuntu Server provides more
up-to-date packages while maintaining stability. It also has extensive documentation
and community support, which is beneficial when configuring security controls,
remote access, and performance monitoring.

The availability of regular security updates and strong support for tools such as
SSH, firewalls, fail2ban, and AppArmor makes Ubuntu Server an appropriate choice
for this operating systems coursework.
